# dllInjection

I created this POC to test Windows Sysmon Create Remote Thread Event ID 8. This is based off of the python code found in Grey Hat Python By Justin Seitz.

## Getting started

This project requires Go to be installed. On OS X with Homebrew you can just run `brew install go`.

Running it then should be as simple as:

```console
$ make
$ ./bin/dllInjection
```

### Testing

``make test``
